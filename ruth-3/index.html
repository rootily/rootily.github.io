  <div class="one">
    <p>When I was six <span>◯</span>r seven years <span>◯</span>ld, gr<span>◯</span>wing up in Pittsburgh, I used t<span>◯</span> take a preci<span>◯</span>us penny of my <span>◯</span>wn and hide it f<span>◯</span>r s<span>◯</span>me<span>◯</span>ne else t<span>◯</span> find. It was a curi<span>◯</span>us c<span>◯</span>mpulsi<span>◯</span>n; sadly, I’ve never been seized by it since. F<span>◯</span>r s<span>◯</span>me reas<span>◯</span>n I always “hid” the penny al<span>◯</span>ng the same stretch <span>◯</span>f sidewalk up the street. I w<span>◯</span>uld cradle it at the r<span>◯</span><span>◯</span>ts <span>◯</span>f a sycam<span>◯</span>re, say, <span>◯</span>r in a h<span>◯</span>le left by a chipped-<span>◯</span>ff piece <span>◯</span>f sidewalk. Then I w<span>◯</span>uld take a piece <span>◯</span>f chalk, and, starting at either end <span>◯</span>f the bl<span>◯</span>ck, draw huge arr<span>◯</span>ws leading up t<span>◯</span> the penny fr<span>◯</span>m b<span>◯</span>th directi<span>◯</span>ns. After I learned t<span>◯</span> write I labeled the arr<span>◯</span>ws: SURPRISE AHEAD <span>◯</span>r M<span>◯</span>NEY THIS WAY. I was greatly excited, during all this arr<span>◯</span>w-drawing, at the th<span>◯</span>ught <span>◯</span>f the first lucky passer-by wh<span>◯</span> w<span>◯</span>uld receive in this way, regardless <span>◯</span>f merit, a free gift fr<span>◯</span>m the universe. But I never lurked ab<span>◯</span>ut. I w<span>◯</span>uld g<span>◯</span> straight h<span>◯</span>me and n<span>◯</span>t give the matter an<span>◯</span>ther th<span>◯</span>ught, until, s<span>◯</span>me m<span>◯</span>nths later, I w<span>◯</span>uld be gripped again by the impulse t<span>◯</span> hide an<span>◯</span>ther penny.</p>
