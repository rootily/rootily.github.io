  <div class="quote">
    <p><span class="one"><span class="lost">Lost</span> really has two disparate meanings. <span class="lost">Losing</span> things is
      about the familiar falling away, getting <span class="lost">lost</span> is about the
      unfamiliar appearing. There are objects and people that
      disappear from your sight or knowledge or possession;</span>
      <span class="two">you <span class="lost">lose</span> a bracelet, a friend, the key. You still know
      where you are. Everything is familiar except that there is
      one item <span class="lost">less</span>, one missing element. Or you get <span class="lost">lost</span>, in</span>
      <span class="three">which case the world has become larger than your
      knowledge of it. Either way, there is a <span class="lost">loss</span> of control.
      Imagine yourself streaming through time shedding </span>
      <span class="four">gloves, umbrellas, wrenches, books, friends, homes,
      names. This is what the view looks like if you take a
      rear-facing seat on the train. Looking forward you </span>
      <span class="five">constantly acquire moments of arrival, moments of
      realization, moments of discovery. The wind blows your
      hair back and you are greeted by what you have never</span>
      <span class="six">seen before. The material falls away in onrushing
      experience. It peels off like skin from a molting snake. Of
      course to forget the past is to <span class="lost">lose</span> the sense of <span class="lost">loss</span> that is</span>
      <span class="seven">also memory of an absent richness and a set of clues to
      navigate the present by; the art is not one of forgetting
      but letting go. And when everything else is gone, you
      can be rich in <span class="lost">loss</span>.</span></p>
