        <p class="alex last">things of that sort, our personal memories, that make the private tapestry of our lives.</p>

      <p class="emily first">This was a good day.</p>

      <p class="emily big">One of the best days, I think.</p>

      <p class="emily">The three of us climbed the lighthouse today and just sat up there for hours, looking out. It’s amazing to see the town from up there – it’s all small, of course, and maplike, and somehow it makes sense in a way that it doesn’t when you’re on the ground. So we started talking about that, and how it would be good if you could only get to a place like that to view your whole life from, if you could see all the far away parts and forgotten parts and parts that you know are there but never really think about, like the alley behind the Spice and Underground, or all those residential cul-de-sacs off Main where the boring houses are.</p>

      <div id="it-is">it is</div>

      <p class="emily middle">We all have stuff like that, though, that is just there that we don’t think about.</p>

      <div class="three">
      <p class="emily small">Like that trip I took with Aunt Sophie last year.</p>
      <p class="emily small">It was great, but it’s not connected to anything else in my life, it’s just this detached memory floating there and I don’t think about it very often.</p>
      <p class="emily small">Which is strange because it was a happy time. </p>
    </div>

      <div class="opacity-75"><p class="emily last">So the three of us just spent about five hours trying to think of all those sorts of memories and telling them to each other. It’s crazy what you find out about people that way.</p></div>
      <p class="emily last">Even your best friends are bigger than you ever imagine. Just&thinsp;—&thinsp;lots of internal landscape.</p>
