    <p>“Tink was not all
      <marquee>— bad — good — bad — good — bad — good —</marquee>: or, rather, she was all <marquee>— bad — good — bad — good — bad — good —</marquee> just now, but, on the other hand, sometimes she was all <marquee>— good — bad — good — bad — good — bad —</marquee>. Fairies have to be one thing or the other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time. They are, however, allowed to change, only it must be a complete change.</p>
