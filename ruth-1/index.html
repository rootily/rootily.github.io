    <p><span class="black">I don’t know if</span> you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island; for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing <span>splashes of colour</span> here and there, and <span>coral reefs</span> and <span>rakish-looking craft</span> in the offing, and <span>savages</span> and <span>lonely lairs</span>, and <span>gnomes</span> who are mostly tailors, and <span>caves</span> through which a river runs, and <span>princes</span> with six elder brothers, and a <span>hut</span> fast going to decay, and one <span>very small old lady</span> with a hooked nose.</p>
